## Project Steps

- Collect publicly available collider datasets from ATLAS and/or CMS experiments

- Compute invariant masses for particle pairs across thousands of events to construct empirical mass distributions

- Identify resonance peaks corresponding to known particles within noisy backgrounds

- Fit parametric models (e.g., Gaussian or Breit–Wigner) to these peaks to estimate particle masses and uncertainties

- Apply statistical methods for uncertainty quantification, including least-squares, likelihood-based inference, and bootstrap or Monte Carlo techniques

## DATA Sources
ATLAS Open Data: https://opendata.cern.ch/
We plan to utilize the publicly released datasets from the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for analysis.

CMS Open Data: https://cms.cern.ch/opendata/
Publicly available data from the CMS experiment at the LHC, offering both real collision data and simulation datasets to be utilized for analysis.

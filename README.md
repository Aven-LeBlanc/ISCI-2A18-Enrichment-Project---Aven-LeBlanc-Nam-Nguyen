# ISCI-2A18-Enrichment-Project---Aven-LeBlanc-Nam-Nguyen
Computational methods to estimate particle masses from public collider data from ATLAS experiment and CMS experiment. We reconstruct invariant mass spectra, fit resonance peaks with parametric models, and quantify uncertainty using reproducible statistical workflows.

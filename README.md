## ISCI-2A18-Enrichment-Project---Aven-LeBlanc-Nam-Nguyen

## Brief Project Overview
We hope to use computational and statistical data analysis to estimate particle masses from publicly available high-energy physics datasets (e.g., ATLAS or CMS collider data). We would like to be able to reconstruct invariant mass distributions from measured particle momenta across thousands of collision events and identify resonance peaks corresponding to known particles. By fitting parametric models to these peaks, we want to estimate particle masses and associated uncertainties.
